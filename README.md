# aastraal-project 

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/githubuser/aastraal-client-brick.png)](https://travis-ci.org/githubuser/aastraal-client-brick)

Aastraal Project is:
- a task manager
- a todo list
- a time-logger

It's a sort of simplistic project manager. Written in Haskell. 

It works in the terminal.

Future versions should include a Viewer/Analyzer in browser (plan to do it in Elm language), and a version working on Android devices.
Future versions should work an optional central server, allowing multiple devices to work within the same projects.

There should also be support for several users.
